# 🔌 Smart Grid Load Forecast Dashboard

A real-time smart grid load forecasting dashboard built using **Streamlit**.  
This project compares two approaches:

- 📈 **Prophet-based ML Forecasting** (Cloud Compatible)
- 📉 **Moving Average Forecasting** (Statistical Baseline)

It uses real-world hourly energy consumption data to simulate smart grid prediction — ideal for city-scale systems like Bengaluru.
